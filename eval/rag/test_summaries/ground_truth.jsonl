These symptoms, lasting 3–4 days, began two months ago and are becoming more frequent, now occurring multiple times daily. The patient also experiences generalized fatigue, occasional nausea, and transient difficulty walking, which colleagues have noticed. Recently, he reported difficulty holding a coffee cup and swallowing during episodes. He denies current symptoms, visual problems, or difficulty speaking outside of episodes. The patient’s father has a history of stroke risk and underwent a carotid surgery. John's past medical workups for diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol were normal. He has been self-medicating with aspirin 75 mg daily since his father’s surgery but has not discussed this with a GP. He has no history of stroke, other illnesses, or smoking, and he lives with his wife.The doctor suspects transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or mini-strokes and is referring the patient to a TIA clinic for urgent assessment within 1–2 days. The clinic will perform carotid ultrasounds and possibly a brain scan to rule out underlying issues. The patient was advised to seek immediate care at A&E if symptoms persist or worsen. Contact numbers for the clinic and support were provided, and the importance of timely follow-up was emphasized."}

{"audio_file": "D1Cons13-Sandra.wav", "text": "Adriana, 26, presented with a 3-day history of headaches, mainly around the right eye. The headache is described as dull but occasionally sharp, with a severity of 8/10 during intense episodes. It is persistent but fluctuates in intensity. Associated symptoms include sensitivity to light and discomfort when exposed to brightness, though there is no reported vision loss or vomiting. She feels generally unwell due to the headache but denies neck stiffness, fever, or neurological symptoms such as limb weakness. Adriana has no personal history of migraines but reports a family history of migraines affecting her mother, who experiences severe episodes triggered by seasonal changes, and her sister, who has infrequent mild migraines. She has been taking Ibuprofen three times daily without relief. She wears glasses, works in IT with prolonged computer use, and mentions recent work-related stress. She socially smokes and drinks alcohol occasionally. The clinical presentation suggests a likely migraine. The plan includes prescribing Naproxen as a stronger anti-inflammatory option and possibly adding Paracetamol or Codeine for additional pain relief. Adriana is advised to keep a headache diary to identify potential triggers. A follow-up appointment is recommended in one to two weeks to assess her response to treatment and discuss preventive options if the headaches persist. She is encouraged to minimize screen brightness, manage stress, and stay hydrated. She is also advised to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen, such as new vision disturbances, limb weakness, or persistent severe headaches."}

They also experienced swelling in both ankles over the past few days and a mild, non-troublesome dry cough. No chest pain, fever, or significant changes in appetite were noted, and they described feeling generally run-down. Current medications include Furosemide, Aspirin, and Bisoprolol, with no reported allergies. The doctor attributed the symptoms to a potential heart failure flare-up. Recommendations included increasing Furosemide dosage to two tablets daily for a few days, organizing blood tests and an echocardiogram to assess heart function, and monitoring symptoms. The patient was advised to return in a week or sooner if symptoms worsen, such as increased breathlessness or chest pain. The patient expressed understanding and agreed to the plan."}
{"audio_file": "D2Cons2-Hamza.wav", "text": "The patient, a 53-year-old male, presented with a one-week history of swelling in the left elbow. He described the swelling as slightly warm to touch and noted a sensation of fluid within the area. The patient reported no pain, functional limitations, or recent injuries to the elbow. He first noticed the swelling in the shower and described it as feeling strange but not causing significant discomfort. The patient denies any prior history of similar swelling or joint-related symptoms beyond a suspected diagnosis of osteoarthritis, which he recalls being discussed by a GP several years ago. There is no family history of rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. He has no other significant medical history aside from a peanut allergy and reports being generally fit and healthy, engaging in regular exercise, including running 2–3 times per week. On examination via video, the swelling was localized to the tip of the elbow and was slightly warm compared to surrounding skin. There was no evidence of redness, severe tenderness, or significant restriction in movement. The patient’s skin was noted to be dry at the tip of the elbow but otherwise unremarkable. The patient denied systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or recent infections. The likely diagnosis is bursitis, an inflammation of the bursa at the elbow. Differential diagnoses include gout, infection, or other inflammatory joint conditions. Septic arthritis is considered unlikely at this time given the absence of redness, intense pain, or systemic signs of infection. The patient was advised to take over-the-counter ibuprofen (400 mg twice daily after food) to manage inflammation and swelling. Blood tests were ordered to evaluate inflammatory markers, infection, and gout-related parameters, as well as to screen for rheumatologic antibodies. The patient was informed that the results would be available in 5–6 days, and follow-up arrangements were made for either a video consultation or an in-clinic appointment to review the findings and assess the elbow. The patient was counseled on red flags, including increasing redness, severe pain, or spreading swelling, which would require immediate medical attention as these could indicate septic arthritis. The patient expressed understanding and agreed to the plan. He was reassured that there is no evidence of a life-threatening condition at this stage but was encouraged to reach out if symptoms worsen."}
