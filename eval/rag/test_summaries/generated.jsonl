He described the swelling as slightly warm to the touch and noted a sensation of fluid within the area, but reported no significant discomfort, functional limitations, or recent injuries to the elbow. He denied any prior history of similar swelling or joint-related symptoms, except for a suspected diagnosis of osteoarthritis discussed by his general practitioner several years ago. There is no family history of rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. His medical history is otherwise unremarkable aside from AP, and he reports being generally fit and healthy, engaging in regular exercise including running two to three times per week.\n\nOn examination via video, the swelling was confined to the tip of the elbow and was slightly warmer than the surrounding skin. There was no evidence of redness, severe tenderness, or significant restriction in movement. The skin at the tip of the elbow appeared dry but was otherwise unremarkable. The patient denied systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or recent infections.\n\nThe clinical impression is that of bursitis, an inflammation of the bursa at the elbow. Differential diagnoses considered include gout, infection, or other inflammatory joint conditions, though septic arthritis is deemed unlikely at this time due to the absence of redness, intense pain, or systemic signs of infection. The patient was advised to take over-the-counter ibuprofen at a dose of 400 milligrams twice daily after food to manage inflammation and swelling. Blood tests were ordered to evaluate inflammatory markers, infection, and gout-related parameters, as well as to screen for rheumatologic antibodies. The patient was informed that results would be available in five to six days, and follow-up arrangements were made for either a video consultation or an in-clinic appointment to review the findings and reassess his condition.\n\nHe was counseled regarding red flag symptoms, including increasing redness, severe pain, or spreading swelling, which would require immediate medical attention as these could indicate septic arthritis. The patient expressed understanding of the plan and was reassured that there is no evidence of a life-threatening condition at this stage, but was encouraged to reach out if symptoms worsen."}
